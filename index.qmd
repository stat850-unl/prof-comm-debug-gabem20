# Reproducible Examples & Debugging

In the following examples, evaluate each problem using the criteria of a minimal reproducible example from [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). 

Specifically, address the following things: 

1. Are the question and problem description complete?

2. Is the issue reproducible? Does it have a description of the problem, with code that reproduces the problem? What could improve it?

3. Is the example minimal? Does it include extra code or information that is not necessary?

4. Does the question describe any attempted solutions?


Then, using what you know about R and Python, try to debug the problem using the strategies in [the debugging chapter](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/06-debugging.html). Once you are thoroughly stumped, or you believe you have solved the problem, compare your solutions to those given on StackOverflow using the link.

## Why Doesn't this R function work?

> I created the following function to append new strings on a vector of strings called "meals". However, when I use this function to append an string input into my "meals" vector, it does not work.

```
 add <- function(str) {
      meals <- append(meals, as.character(str))  
    }
```

1. Are the question and problem description complete?

> Yes, given the goal it sounds like it does.

2. Is the issue reproducible? Does it have a description of the problem, with code that reproduces the problem? What could improve it?

> The problem is less of an error that would occur but rather code that isn't producing desired results. Given the code, to test one could create their own meal vector and test the function.

3. Is the example minimal? Does it include extra code or information that is not necessary?

> It is minimal as it only includes the code for the given problem and nothing extra.

4. Does the question describe any attempted solutions?

> No, it doesn't. Just the written function and what is supposed to happen.


## Function not working R

> I've never programmed before and am trying to learn. I'm following that "coursera" course that I've seen other people post about â€” a course offered by Johns Hopkins on R programming.

> Anyway, this was supposed to be my first function. Yet, it doesn't work! But when I type out all the steps individually, it runs just fine... Can anyone tell me why?

```
pollutantmean <- function(directory, pollutant, id = 1:332){
    x<- list.files("/Users/mike******/Desktop/directory", full.names=TRUE)
    y<- lapply(x, read.csv)
    z<- do.call(rbind.data.frame, y[id])

    mean(z$pollutant, na.rm=TRUE)
}
pollutantmean(specdata,nitrate,1:10)
[1] NA
Warning message:
In mean.default(z$pollutant, na.rm = TRUE) :
  argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

####

x<- list.files("/Users/mike******/Desktop/specdata",full.names=TRUE)
y<- lapply(x,read.csv)
z<- do.call(rbind.data.frame,y[1:10])
mean(z$nitrate,na.rm=TRUE)

1. Are the question and problem description complete?

> The provided question isn't complete and requires the reader to look further into the code to see what the poster is attempting to achieve.

2. Is the issue reproducible? Does it have a description of the problem, with code that reproduces the problem? What could improve it?

> The provided code isn't necessarily reproducible for a reader because it is based on the posters directory. The reader provides code that works but isn't the same to the problem code. Attempt to create the issue with other data or ensure the example code provided is more similar to the problem.

3. Is the example minimal? Does it include extra code or information that is not necessary?

> I would say it is pretty minimal. The provided working code could be viwed as extra, however, this is a good reference to the issues in the function error.

4. Does the question describe any attempted solutions?

> It doesn't describe any attempted solutions.


## Inexplicable error when trying to export my R notebook

```

> However, all my plots are coming out successfully. I can clearly see in the data that the species column is there and that Cellana is a species. No spelling errors or anything.

1. Are the question and problem description complete?

> I think the description of the problem is sufficient. It shows the error and explains what is expected. It would be assumed that a reader would have experience with markdown files so they understand what compiling a file is.

2. Is the issue reproducible? Does it have a description of the problem, with code that reproduces the problem? What could improve it?

## Python if elif else statement

> I'm trying to create a program with python that calculate the cost for shipping.

> However, I can't run the program to where it works properly.

> What ever my total is the same amount comes out as $6 for US and $8 for Canada. I can't seem to get pass that.

> Example:

```
total = raw_input('What is the total amount for your online shopping?')
country = raw_input('Shipping within the US or Canada?')

if country == "US":
    if total <= "50":
        print "Shipping Costs $6.00"
    elif total <= "100":
            print "Shipping Costs $9.00"
    elif total <= "150":
            print "Shipping Costs $12.00"
    else:
        print "FREE"

if country == "Canada":
    if total <= "50":
        print "Shipping Costs $8.00"
    elif total <= "100":
        print "Shipping Costs $12.00"
    elif total <= "150":
        print "Shipping Costs $15.00"
    else:
        print "FREE"

# Professional Communication

## Slides

Create a set of quarto slides in the file slides.qmd. 

Set two different output formats - for instance, reveal.js and beamer. 

In your slides:

- Introduce yourself and show a picture of yourself
- Provide basic biographical information: birthday, where you grew up
- Show a picture of your favorite animal
- Provide your favorite plot, generated in either R or python. (This can be one you've generated in this class). Ensure that the code does not show, but the plot does.
- Provide a link to your CV, which you will generate in the next part.

## CV

Select a CV template that uses either LaTeX or Markdown:

- https://github.com/kazuyanagimoto/quarto-awesomecv-typst
- https://github.com/schochastics/quarto-cv
- https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/cv

Use the template to create a curriculum vitae that has your education, work experience, and any other sections you would like to include. Compile your CV and link to it in your slides.
