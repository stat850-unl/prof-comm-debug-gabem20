## About Me

Hi my name is Gabe Macklem. I am from Denver, Colorado and received my Bachelors in Statistics from Colorado State University. In my free time, I enjoy being outside, working out, spending time with friends, and watching sports. 


## Favorite Animal

My favorite animal would have to be either a moose or mountain lion. No particular reason other than I think they are cool!

## Favorite Graph I Have Made

A graph that I had made that I was proud of was a plot comparing PFF Grades, used to assess football players abilities compared across a players year in college and draft status. I used this to determine if PFF Grades could signal draft status and when in a given players career is it noticeable.
